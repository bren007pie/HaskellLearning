13 questions, 19 points


The assignment was marked out of 14. I thought it was 1 mark per question and 13 questions unless I'm mistaken? Just curious, I may have missed one.

- based on my marking I should have gotten (1+2+2 + 1+2+2+ (maybe 1/3 for MultComm)
- So there was +2 (assuming got 1 on MultComm)+1+2+1+1+2
- So in my scheme I should get 11/20. Or by questions 7.5/13. Makes sense
From Carette:
Your editor seems to make long lines out of stuff... can you reconfigure it so that it doesn't?
Your comments are probably too verbose. The content of them (like for `inc`) is good, but you could have said the same thing with way fewer words.

Also, when commenting, don't bother with saying "base case" and "inductive case". Do say what you induct on though.  Example of good comments:
dbl : ℕ → ℕ 
dbl zero = zero  -- 2*0 = 0
dbl (suc m) = suc (suc (dbl m))  -- 2*(m+1) = (2*m) + 2

If you're commenting stuff that's already in the file for your own understanding (like 7+7=14 in binary), great, but no need to hand that in...

I prefer to have the equational proofs aligned differently (justifications on the right)

when proofs are trivial (like 'refl') such as in the first case of AddDistMult, go ahead and use that!
The weird error in *-comm is that you had 'n⟩' instead of 'n ⟩' (see that space?) and so it was taking the 'n⟩' as a single token and was missing the closing '⟩'.
Grading:
- -1 for incomplete *-comm
- -6 for missing pieces
7 / 14 - 50 %, I'm not sure how this is out of 14. There are 13 questions, and if using other scoring scheme there is 20 points. Was I missing a question?
Q) graded A1 out of 14 but I only counted 13 questions, was there a bonus or something? Also would you consider marking by points because some are much harder? Are there part marks for structures of a solution?
