More.agda (15 points)
	Copy over More.agda
	Understand Debruijn
	Understand how they added product types and how to make your own
	Add empty type (recommended)
	Add sum types (recommended)
	Add unit type (practice)
	Add Boolean based on Agda/Haskell base. Similar to Nat type
	Bonus: Add list type (practice)

I like going through one-at-a-time to implement

NEVER GIVE UP

I can sympothsize, or we can pass time
I need love, real love

Things needed to add each type:
1. Syntax (for opererators)
2. Types
3. Type judgements
4. Rename cases
5. Subst cases
6. Values
7. Reduction rules 
8. Values do not reduce cases
9. Progress cases
10. test/examples


Tips for implementing types:
0. Follow PLFA types for EVERYTHING. Including naming, rules, etc. It's a bit hard to translate because it's written with named terms (not De Brujn indicies) so syntax is weird. But once you get the hang of it it's just translation.
1. Do one at a time
2. Don't move on until all errors are cleared
3. Do it in test-driven engineering order: try to implement test then do syntax, types, type judgements. When type judgements are done can do rename/subst and start progress but leave hole(s).
- Then do reduction rules, try more example, then values, do value do not need to reduce, can finish example, leave progress until the end.
- Actually once I got the hang of it I started doing syntax, types, type judgements, then doing rename, subst, and progress leaving a hole to clear errors. Then doing values, values do not reduce, reduction rules, and finishing off progress. All while making sure along the way there were no errors and everything was clean. Then would finish off with examples/tests
4. Progress has 1 case for each reduction rule + value of a type (so that it's deterministic)
5. V\eng\em\to needs new cases for new values except for unit type.
- getting over the initial hurdle of stress and understanding was a lot but once you understand the process and the PLFA translation it's quite "easy" (knock on wood). But getting there is a rough process and when you're stuck with no end in sight it's tough. I see why it's so easy for Dr. Carette but probably hard to remember how tough it is and the entire night not being able to sleep and being in crisis mode because of stress of not getting empty/sum type and school stress of future work. It's a lot but push through it slowly and you'll get there.
- Also once making progress it's a grove. Did 8 hours yesterday because one I got it it was very mechanical and everything fell into replace. Sleep helps, tea is great, library is great. Once it's the accuate deadline having the big moniter setup at home was a play though. Having windows open for each of the rules was big quality of life improvement.
6. Once rules written and right use the evaluator to write tests for you with C-c C-n eval (gas n) (expression)


I FUCKING DID IT, IT'S 2:30 AM BUT I DID IT!
