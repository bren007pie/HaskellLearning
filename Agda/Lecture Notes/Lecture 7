Projection is accessing fields of a record. A\~-B is a record, 4 fields or dimensions. To select 1 it's called a projection. Think about cross operator (X) where you project onto an axis. Record in this case has 4 axis so project onto one to acess the field. Wack terminology but makes sense
C-U C-U C-C C-, gives even more refined goal
Make smaller steps then ask what to do
construct bones then approach
