-- PLFA coverage of identity, associativity, commutativity, distributivity.
-- Properties of operatorsies
-- Common names for common properties operators
-- identity: The identity is the side the zero is on. If it's both sides it's called identity. E.g. left identiy of +: 0 + n ≡ n
-- Associativity: Associative if the parenthesis location doesn't matter. E.g. +/* is assocative with itself
-- Commutativity: Commute if order of arguments don't matter. E.g. +/* commutes
-- Distributivity: operator distributes over operators. E.g. * distributes left or right over +
-- can check if an operator has an identiy/unit (0/1 for +/*), is associative, is commutitive or distributes over another.

-- Exercise operator:
-- pair of operators that have identity, associatiity, commute, and distribute over eachother.
  -- ^ and * have identity, associativity, communtivity, and ^ distributes over * but not vise versa
  -- operator that has identity and associative but not commutive: - has 0 identity and is associative.
    -- / is actually not associative so order of the parenthesis does matter

-- An example of the associative law for addition, presented using equational reasoning.
-- here we do a proof breaking it down into equational reasoning

-- use induction to prove that a property holds for all of its type
-- Proof by induction
-- 1. Need to prove it holds for base case(s), the "zero" case
-- 2. Need to prove forinductive case: assume property holds for an arbitrary case (say p(k) or m) which is the induction hypothesis. THEN show property holds for next case (p(k+1) or suc(m)). Then we know it holds for all k or all ℕ.
-- P m is the property holding for the before case (yesterday) then it will hold for today P (suc m). We get two properties: P zero and P m to build our case. Then induction proves P (suc zero), P (suc (suc zero)), .... ad infinitum

-- Associativity proof by induction
-- P m (induction hypothesis) is that: (m + n) + p ≡ m + (n + p). Here if it holds for m it also holds for n and p because those are both just arbitrary natural numbers.

+-assoc′′ : ∀ (m n p : ℕ) → (m + n) + p ≡ m + (n + p)  -- here saying for all natural numbers, where we define m,n, and p to be of type ℕ then the statement/induction hypothesis hold.
+-assoc′′ zero n p =  -- doing proof for base case, m=0, strange that we don't have to write out the other side
  begin  -- lhs m=0
    (zero + n) + p
  ≡⟨⟩  -- definition of plus
    n + p
  ≡⟨⟩ -- definition of plus
    zero + (n + p)
  ∎
+-assoc′′ (suc m) n p =
  begin
    (suc m + n) + p
  ≡⟨⟩
    suc (m + n) + p
  ≡⟨⟩
    suc ((m + n) + p)
  ≡⟨ cong suc (+-assoc′′ m n p) ⟩
    suc (m + (n + p))
  ≡⟨⟩
    suc m + (n + p)
  ∎
 -- now doing proof for inductive case m+1 or suc(m)
-- induction hypothesis, here we're adding in a justification in the chain of reasoning. Using the definition of the unduction hypthoses itself.
  -- use cog b.c. congruence is true for a relation if applying a function preserves the relation. E.g. e is evidence, f is a function, and x≡y is a relation. then cong f e is evidence that f x ≡ f y.
-- here induction hypothesis is not assumed but proved by recursive function calls with +-assoc.

-- In Agda identifiers can be any sequences of character except for space and these characters: @.(){};_
-- A theorem easy to prove.

+-identityᴸ : ∀ (m : ℕ) → zero + m ≡ m

-- A first nontrivial theorem.
-- An equational proof is shown in PLFA.
-- Instead we will use 'rewrite'.

+-identityʳ : ∀ (m : ℕ) → m + zero ≡ m

-- PLFA's proof uses helpers cong and sym imported from the standard library,
-- and a form of equational reasoning that allows more elaborate justification than above.
-- We can use cong in place of rewrite.

+-identityʳ′ zero = refl
