Assignment 2

Do all holes (in prefilled ones) marked as exercises in Relations.agda and Isomorphisms.agda.

Bonus: *-mono-<= in Relations.agda.


A2 is out - see Avenue. Basically: all the parts marked 'exercises' in filled/Relations.agda and filled/Isomorphisms.agda.  Due next Wednesday (Oct. 6th) in the evening.


The description (also on Avenue) now reads:


Do the following exercises

in Relations.agda	
LTTrans, 
Trichotomy, 
LEtoLTS, 
LEStoLT, 
LTtoSLE, 
LTStoLE, 
OPOE
	
	
	
Isomorphisms.agda.
I will give you 'canonical' solutions to inc, tob, dblb and fromb, [by email, since one person has had an extension]
		
IncCanOne, 
OneInc, 
CanToB, 
OneDblX0, 
OneToFrom, 
CanToFrom, 
OneUnique, 
CanUnique, 
Rewrap, 
IsoNCanR


Tips from Dr. Carette:
Assignments I just finished preparing the solutions for A2. So some hints:
- it's much easier to split things up into smaller files and import old things than to copy-paste. [I made some mistakes because I had different versions of the function in different files, and that caused much pain.]  I already did that with A1.
- the points associated to each function are a strong indication of their difficulty. OneToFrom really is more difficult (but not so bad if you do an equational proof and you have all your lemmas handy for re-use)
- using copatterns for IsoNCanR leads to a much simpler-looking proof.  As the things you need to fill are functions, you can then actually add that extra variable to the lhs and pattern-match on it as well. 
- after you split, the proof of OneDblbX0 should all be 'refl'. If it's not, you're using a bad 'dblb' implementation.
